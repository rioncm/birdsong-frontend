# Frontend â†” Backend Integration Notes

This document tracks how the planned frontend experience maps to the current BirdSong API, and where we may need new or expanded endpoints (targets for backend v1.1).

## Existing API Surface (backend/app/api.py)
- `GET /detections` (`DetectionFeedResponse`)  
  - Filters: optional `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `species_id`, `min_confidence`.  
  - Pagination: `page`, `page_size` (offset-based).  
  - Returns flat detections with ISO `recorded_at`, species metadata, and recording path.
- `GET /species/{species_id}` (`SpeciesDetailResponse`)  
  - Provides taxonomic info, AI summary, and citation details per species.
- Other modules (e.g., `/analyze` ingestion endpoints) exist but are not directly used by the read-only frontend.

## Gaps & Follow-ups for v1.1
1. **Timeline bucketing**  
   - Frontend needs detections grouped into 5-minute windows. Current `/detections` response is flat; grouping would require client-side processing of large pages.  
   - Proposal: add optional `bucket=5m` flag returning aggregated buckets with nested detections, or expose a dedicated `/detections/timeline` endpoint accepting `start`, `end`, and bucket size.

2. **Time-range pagination**  
   - Infinite scroll requires deterministic cursors (e.g., `before`/`after` timestamps). Offset pagination will skip or duplicate entries as new detections arrive.  
   - Proposal: support `before=<ISO>` and `limit` to fetch earlier buckets relative to a cursor.

3. **Quarter-day presets**  
   - UI defaults to most recent quarter. Backend should expose either:  
     - helper endpoint `/detections/quarters` returning available ranges per day, or  
     - ability to query `/detections` with `start`/`end` timestamps (see #1).

4. **Media URLs**  
   - `recording.path` currently returns a filesystem path (e.g., `/app/data/...`). Frontend needs a downloadable/streamable URL, ideally signed or proxied through an API endpoint.

5. **Location metadata**  
   - `location_hint` is hard-coded to `"unknown"`. If cameras/mics carry location labels, surface them so the UI can show origin per detection bucket.

6. **Image attribution details**  
   - Response includes `image_url` but lacks attribution text/source license. Consider adding `image_credit` / `image_source_url` to support required credits.

7. **Health / status endpoint**  
   - Helpful for frontend to detect maintenance mode or empty-state messaging (optional but nice-to-have).

## Open Questions for Backend Team
- Should summary stats (total detections, unique species) be computed server-side for custom ranges?  
- Are there rate limits we must respect when polling for new detections?  
- Any plan for websockets or SSE in future releases? (If so, keep naming consistent.)  
- How will authentication evolve if/when user accounts land (impacting anonymous frontend)?
